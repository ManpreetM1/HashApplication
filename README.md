# Hash Application
This is an web application which computes a hash for a given message using your choice of several different cryptographic hashing algorithms.

## Description
This project allows a user to hash any written message using one of the provided hashing algorithms. This list of algorithms will likely be expanded later, with support for hashing uploaded files as well. These hashes are computed using a python flask backend. More features are likely to be added later to improve functionality for this application.
